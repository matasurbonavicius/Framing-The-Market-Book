## The Book

This book was a 6-months project while I was a senior risk analyst in Danske Bank, to dive as deep as I could into what constitutes a trading plan and also - how to actually plan the results of the trading "system" prior to even testing the system, which is most often the case with discretionary trading.

This was analyzed through two lenses:

1. What is a trading plan? -> essentially a documentation of a lifecycle of a single trade. Then by repeating that lifecycle -> contratulations you are trading
2. How to actually plan the results without even testing the system? -> look into position sizing strategy and the desired risk/return ratio, which determines the win rate. With these, one can simulate the distrubution of possible outcomes over a given period of trades and calculate probabilities.

What I aimed to find was a magical way to write a trading plan that will make me profitable long term.

What I found is a deeper desire to build algorithmic trading systems, rather than trade discretionary. I think logic is something along the lines of:

1. If you want to trade with a trading plan, then sure, do it. But you can write a trading plan as a set of rules around the trade lifecycle (how do you want to make trades). And if you can write a set of rules, then you can automate it. Then why in the world would you want to not do that? Do you want to sit every day and repeat the same thing over and over again? That's brain damage and boring to the bone.

2. If you truly want to be a discretionary trader, then trading plan is not the way to go. Its for algo guys. You have to know the markets by the gut, have courage and discipline, go out there and just absolutely dominate. But this is not something that any trader can put onto paper easily. I used to speak with traders in the bank, retail guys, wallstreet and I would ask them HOW DO YOU DO THAT DUDE and their answer of "I don't know man it's just the time in the market" would annoy me so much, because WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY, but I think there is truth to it.

This description is a reflection 2 years after finishing the book. It was an incredible project that was totally worth it. Now, should you read it?

50/50

I was 24 when I wrote this, used no editor, so the brainpower was definitely limited, as was experience. But the chapters about the RR and how that translates to win rate and then how it translates to different risk profiles? That is good. Should be in the ENTRY chapter.

Enjoy =)
